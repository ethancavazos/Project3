Hi Everyone!

In SDS 348, we learned a LOT of cool things. My favorite adventure in the class was definitely learning Python! I had particular fun with it because I already had some knowledge from CS303E. It was really awesome to see how I could apply what I thought of as "traditional" python programming to RStudio since our entry-level biostatistics class is taught a bit differenetly than the comp-sci one. 

Anyway! Here lies my favorite homework problem! I thought it was a really nice union between programming and molecular bioscience. 
```{r setup, include = FALSE}
library(reticulate)
reticulate::use_python("C:\\Users\\edog\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python36\\python.exe",required=TRUE)
```

#Find all 3-mers in these two sequences

```{python}
my_seq1 = "ATCATCATG"
my_seq2 = "CAGCCCAATCAGGCTCTACTGCCACTAAACTTACGCAGGATATATTTACGCCGACGTACT"
def kmers(seq, k):


    counts = {}
    kmers = len(seq) - k + 1


    for i in range(kmers):

        kmer = seq[i:i+k]

        if kmer not in counts:
            counts[kmer] = 0
        counts[kmer] += 1
```

We did learn a lot of other really cool things, though. I'll definitely be re-formatting my blog posts and tailor each one to specific topics and helpful pieces of code for subjects like regex, regressions, dplyr, etc. 

I would also like to link some pictures of my research adventures to some posts (see below) so please stay tuned! :-)
