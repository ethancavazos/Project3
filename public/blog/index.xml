      <description>Hi Everyone!
In SDS 348, we learned a LOT of cool things. My favorite adventure in the class was definitely learning Python! I had particular fun with it because I already had some knowledge from CS303E. It was really awesome to see how I could apply what I thought of as “traditional” python programming to RStudio since our entry-level biostatistics class is taught a bit differenetly than the comp-sci one.</description>
